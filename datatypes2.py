# Purpose: A program to calculate simple interest

# Ask the user for the principal
principal = float(input("Enter principal: "))
# principal = float(principal)

# Ask the user for the interest rate
rate = float(input("Enter rate: "))
# rate = float(rate)

# Ask the user for the length of time
time = float(input("Enter time in years: "))
#time = float(time)

# Simple interest calculation
amount = principal * rate * time

# Display the answer
print("The interest amount is", amount)
